Things to do on Selenium project:

Basic:
* Make sure Firefox plugins exist before loading them
* Sort out Run.java
* Singleton of the WebDriver? This would also remove it as an object to pass through to the screenshot class
* * This has already been implemented but I'm going to revert it.  One Driver means concurrent testing is not possible.
* Add in site builder? 
* * Shift all processes into a new package
* * Will these process handlers be similar enough to use an interface?
* While SiteList will mainly be claims_X it can deal with council websites, need to handle the difference between http:// and without it
* * Need to investiagte if this has any effect.
* Sort out SiteGobbler so it works.
* Find out what firestarter does again
* Implement JUnit 4 and Assert.

Advanced:
* Add in multiple broswers again
* Proper logging rather than System.out
* * Make sure those three elements currently unused in Screenshot are used again.
* Implement uses for Firebug, log reporting, recording missing elements, resource loading, etc.
* * Add in YSlow?
* Create a GUI
* * Allow the config to be modified through the GUI
* Test Script parser so the code deosn't need to be compiled each time a change it made.
* Run multiple tests at once?
